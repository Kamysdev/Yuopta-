# Yuopta++
### Yuopta++ is a completely new header for c++, which allows you to program in vocabulary familiar to every Russian person, while maintaining the style of the c++ language

Only in this header you can meet such constructions as "жигули" (analogous to for), "начусл" (everyone familiar with the algorithmic language) and others

Yuopta++ is currently being developed by one person, and the project itself is inspired by YoptaScript
